## What is Dayflow?

Dayflow is a **native macOS app** (SwiftUI) that watches your screen, analyzes it with AI, and generates a **timeline** of your activities with summaries.
It's lightweight (25MB app size) and uses ~100MB of RAM and <1% cpu. 

> _Privacy‑minded by design_: You choose your AI provider. Use **Gemini** (bring your own API key), **local models** (Ollama / LM Studio), or **ChatGPT/Claude** (requires paid subscription). See **Data & Privacy** for details.


## Why Dayflow

Most time trackers only log app usage. Dayflow understands context - the difference between "researching on YouTube" and "watching cat videos" - so your timeline reflects real work, not just which window was open.

It's fully open‑source and extensible: inspect the codebase, audit how data is handled, and build it yourself for maximum security.

## How people get value

- **Founders:** See where days disappear, balance maker vs. manager time, and spot hidden context switching.
- **Engineers:** Verify what really shipped, generate a standup recap in minutes, and reduce interruption drag.
- **Students:** Make study sessions visible, reduce distraction drift, and build better routines.
- **AI researchers:** See where time actually went across experiments vs. reading vs. coding, and tighten your research loop.
- **Marketing:** Track time by campaign/channel, protect creative blocks, and cut hidden ops overhead.
- **Sales:** Make calls, follow‑ups, and CRM time visible; prep pipeline recaps fast.
- **Freelancers:** Generate client‑ready summaries, show proof of work, and catch scope creep early.


---

  <div align="center">
    <img src="docs/images/DashboardPreview.png" alt="Dayflow dashboard preview" width="800">
  </div>

## How it works

1) **Capture** - Watches your screen in lightweight chunks.
2) **Analyze** - Periodically sends recent activity to your chosen AI provider.
3) **Generate** - AI creates timeline cards with activity summaries.
4) **Display** - Shows your day as a visual timeline.
5) **Cleanup** - Auto-manages storage based on your configured limits (1GB–20GB or unlimited).

### AI Processing Pipeline

The efficiency of your timeline generation depends on your chosen AI provider:

## Data & Privacy

This section explains **what Dayflow stores locally**, **what leaves your machine**, and **how provider choices affect privacy**.

### Data locations (on your Mac)

All Dayflow data is stored in:
`~/Library/Application Support/Dayflow/`

- **Recordings (video chunks):** `Dayflow/recordings/` (or choose "Open Recordings..." from the Dayflow Taskbar Icon Menu)
- **Local database:** `Dayflow/chunks.sqlite`
- **Recording details:** Lightweight screen capture, analyzed periodically, configurable storage limits
- **Purge / reset tip:** Quit Dayflow. Then delete the entire `Dayflow/` folder to remove recordings and analysis artifacts. Relaunch to start fresh.

### Processing modes & providers
- **Gemini (cloud, BYO key)** - Dayflow sends batch payloads to **Google's Gemini API** for analysis.
- **Local models (Ollama / LM Studio)** - Processing stays **on‑device**; Dayflow talks to a **local server** you run.
- **ChatGPT / Claude (CLI-based, paid plan required)** - Dayflow drives the **Codex CLI** (ChatGPT) or **Claude Code CLI** directly on your Mac. **Requires an active ChatGPT Plus/Pro or Claude Pro subscription.** Uses frontier reasoning models for best-in-class narrative quality.

### TL;DR: Gemini data handling (my reading of Google’s ToS)
- **Short answer: There is a way to prevent Google from training on your data.** If you **enable Cloud Billing** on **at least one** Gemini API project, Google treats **all of your Gemini API and Google AI Studio usage** under the **“Paid Services”** data‑use rules - **even when you’re using unpaid/free quota**. Under Paid Services, **Google does not use your prompts/responses to improve Google products/models**.  
  - Terms: “When you activate a Cloud Billing account, all use of Gemini API and Google AI Studio is a ‘Paid Service’ with respect to how Google Uses Your Data, even when using Services that are offered free of charge.” ([Gemini API Additional Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services-how-google-uses-your-data))  
  - Abuse monitoring: even under Paid Services, Google **logs prompts/responses for a limited period** for **policy enforcement and legal compliance**. ([Same Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services-how-google-uses-your-data))  
  - **EEA/UK/Switzerland:** the **Paid‑style data handling applies by default** to **all Services** (including AI Studio and unpaid quota) **even without billing**. ([Same Terms](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#unpaid-services-how-google-uses-your-data))

**A couple useful nuances** (from docs + forum clarifications):
- **AI Studio is still free** to use; enabling billing changes **data handling**, not whether Studio charges you. ([Pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing))  
- **UI “Plan: Paid” check:** In **AI Studio → API keys**, you’ll typically see “Plan: Paid” once billing is enabled on any linked project (UI may evolve).  
- **Free workaround:** _“Make one project paid, keep using a free key elsewhere to get the best of both worlds.”_ The **Terms** imply **account‑level** coverage once any billing account is activated, but the **Apps** nuance above may limit this in specific UI contexts. **Treat this as an interpretation, not legal advice.**

### Local mode: privacy & trade‑offs
- **Privacy:** With **Ollama/LM Studio**, prompts and model inference run on your machine. LM Studio documents full **offline** operation once models are downloaded.
- **Quality/latency:** Local open models are improving but **can underperform** cloud models on complex summarization.
- **Power/battery:** Local inference is **GPU‑heavy** on Apple Silicon and will drain battery faster; prefer **plugged‑in** sessions for long captures.
- **Future:** We may explore **fine‑tuning** or distilling a local model for better timeline summaries.

### ChatGPT/Claude mode: privacy & trade‑offs
- **Privacy:** Your screen data is processed by OpenAI (ChatGPT) or Anthropic (Claude) depending on which CLI you configure. Review their respective privacy policies.
- **Quality:** Frontier reasoning models provide the highest quality narratives and summaries.
- **Subscription required:** You **must have an active paid subscription** (ChatGPT Plus/Pro at $20+/month, or Claude Pro at $20/month). The CLI tools authenticate through your existing subscription.
- **Setup:** Requires installing the [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and staying signed in.
- **Internet:** Requires an active internet connection (no offline mode).

### Permissions (macOS)
To record your screen, Dayflow requires the **Screen & System Audio Recording** permission. Review or change later at:  
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio Recording**.  
Apple’s docs: https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-access-screen-system-audio-recording-mchld6aa7d23/mac

## Configuration

- **AI Provider**
  - Choose **Gemini** (set API key), **Local** (Ollama/LM Studio), or **ChatGPT/Claude** (install CLI + paid subscription).
  - For Gemini keys: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key
  - For ChatGPT: Install [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), sign in with your **ChatGPT Plus/Pro** account
  - For Claude: Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), sign in with your **Claude Pro** account
- **Capture settings**
  - Start/stop capture from the main UI. Use **Debug** to verify batch contents.
- **Data locations**
  - See **Data & Privacy** for exact paths and a purge tip.

---

## Automation

Dayflow registers a `dayflow://` URL scheme so you can trigger common actions from Shortcuts, hotkey launchers, or scripts.

**Supported URLs**
- `dayflow://start-recording` - enable capture (no-op if already recording)
- `dayflow://stop-recording` - pause capture (no-op if already paused)

**Quick checks**
- From Terminal: `open dayflow://start-recording` or `open dayflow://stop-recording`
- In Shortcuts: add an **Open URLs** action with either link above

Deeplink-triggered state changes are logged as `reason: "deeplink"` in analytics so you can distinguish automations from manual toggles.

## Debug & Developer Tools

You can click the Dayflow icon in the menu bar and view the saved recordings

## Project structure

```
Dayflow/
├─ Dayflow/                 # SwiftUI app sources (timeline UI, debug UI, capture & analysis pipeline)
├─ docs/                    # Appcast and documentation assets (screenshots, videos)
├─ scripts/                 # Release automation (DMG, notarization, appcast, Sparkle signing, one-button release)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Screen capture is blank or fails**  
  Check System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Screen & System Audio Recording** and ensure **Dayflow** is enabled.
- **API errors**  
  Go into settings and verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` and network connectivity.
